            A little about where I grew up
        </h1>
        <p>
            It wasn't super pretty but it was full of complete degenrates and it lead to some of the greatest stories of my life. Take a look at some of what I grew up with here below:

            <h4>... managed to burn the shed down completely at 7.</h4>
            <p>Story time! When I was young I was confident and able to do a lot of things that most people wouldn't have ever expected. I also ended up getting a friend who was the wrong crowd if you know what I mean. We decided to sluff school, fish golf balls out of a lack and sell them back to golfers, steal from a gas station and more! At this church, there is a shed that's not attached and we were walking by it. Never seen it open before so we went into it. We had stolen lighters and I was kind of a pyro (yeah, even at 7. Crazy.). So, I started lighting fires and putting them out till I decided to let one get as big as I was comfortable putting out. Right as I was about to put it out the kid I was with threw a gas can on it. At that moment, I knew that putting it out (or trying to) could end badly. So, I had us run. 

            We got caught for sure. I still got baptized in the following months after turning 8. All charges dropped. I even got to go to the firestation and shoot the water hose! Super fun.

            <h4>This is a beautiful course and it's been around for ages and ages.</h4>
            <p> They even let people in to ski/snowboard during the winter when no one can golf. Or.... at least they used to. I know that they've gotten harder on letting people do it because of liability. Like the one time my brother broke his wrist when he faceplanted while boarding. I don't think they allow it anymore. Good news though! They still have water and you could probably still fish out golf balls to sell back to golfers, HA.</p>

                I wanted to touch on this place also because they were legit so cool to me. They told me that I was too young to be making mistakes like that and that they saw a better future for me. So, they gave me a tour. I got to see the insides, play on the trucks, slide on the poles, and shoot the water hose. That was the coolest thing! Straight legit. I'll always remember what those gents did for a little kid like me.
